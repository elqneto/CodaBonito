fAddPitchLines(
  plotObject,
  nXLimit = 120,
  nYLimit = 80,
  cLineColour = "white",
  cPitchColour = "#038253"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plotObject}{a ggplot object. Can just be a blank ggplot object too}

\item{nXLimit}{Length of the pitch}

\item{nYLimit}{Breadth of the pitch}

p1 = ggplot()
p1 = fAddPitchLines(p1)

p1
# adding passing data on top now
